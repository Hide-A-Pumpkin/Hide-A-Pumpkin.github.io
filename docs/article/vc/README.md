Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) is an authoring tool for a special kind of tutor for a special kind 
of tutor that provides step-wise, personalized, and immediate feedback based on a cognitive model for students while they are solving problems.

We aim to make the tool feasible for teachers to :

1. Create a cognitive tutor without requiring the knowledge of programming.

2. Use tutors with students as homework and extra practice.

During the summer intern, we realized several goals:

1. Convert CTAT from the java application to a web-based tutor.

2. Brainstorm and efficient ideas to improve user experience on the web-based tool based on the previous user feedback and surveys.

3. Redesign dated & difficult to use features such as graph properties and graph edits & ability to add hints and skills to the tutor.
