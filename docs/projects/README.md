Here are some works of mine! :books:

## Projects

**Human Computer Interaction Research Project**

 Advisor: Meng Xia, Postdoctoral Faculty, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, CMU

 We hope to explore  teacher behaviors to help improve intelligent tutor systems. We built an interaction interface presenting students’ problem-solving processes, including hint-asking behaviors to help teachers understand student process of solving problems.
 Then we conducted a within-subject user study with math teachers to derive data insights for improving intelligent tutors.
 Paper submitted and under censoring for CHI 2023 as the second author.

**Human Computer Interaction Intern**

  Advisor: Vincent Aleven, Professor, Human-Computer Interaction Institute, CMU

 I worked as summer intern in the group. I  helped build a web-based intelligent tutoring tool which provides step-wise, personalized and immediate feedback based on a cognitive model for students.
  Specially, I built an editor with formula matcher for student input and bound skills with each interaction

**Deep Learning Research Project**

  Advisor: Yanwei Fu, Professor, School of Data Science, Fudan University

 This was the final project task of Deep Learning and Neural Network. I  built a neural network framework for few-shot oracle character recognition problems with my teammate.
 We applied non-rigid transformation as a data augmentation method for our training and reached a significant increase of accuracy through comprehensive experiments.
  Paper accepted for ACCV2022 as the lead author.

**Data Visualization Research Project**

  Advisor: Siming Chen, Professor, School of Data Science, Fudan University

 The first formal research experience in my school. I independently researched on 3D point cloud segmentation, built a system for interactive point cloud labeling combined with default labeling using deep learning method. After that, I proposed an innovative interactive labeling method using SVM, density-based clustering and Fitts's law.
